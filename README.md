### Suffix automaton Algorithm

In computer science, a suffix automaton is an efficient data structure for representing the substring index of a given string which allows the storage, processing, and retrieval of compressed information about all its substrings. The suffix automaton of a string {\displaystyle S}S is the smallest directed acyclic graph with a dedicated initial vertex and a set of "final" vertices, such that paths from the initial vertex to final vertices represent the suffixes of the string.

```
void sa_extend(char c) {
    int cur = sz++;
    st[cur].len = st[last].len + 1;
    int p = last;
    while (p != -1 && !st[p].next.count(c)) {
        st[p].next[c] = cur;
        p = st[p].link;
    }
    if (p == -1) {
        st[cur].link = 0;
    } else {
        int q = st[p].next[c];
        if (st[p].len + 1 == st[q].len) {
            st[cur].link = q;
        } else {
            int clone = sz++;
            st[clone].len = st[p].len + 1;
            st[clone].next = st[q].next;
            st[clone].link = st[q].link;
            while (p != -1 && st[p].next[c] == q) {
                st[p].next[c] = clone;
                p = st[p].link;
            }
